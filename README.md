# little-interpreter
 ## simple interpreter for my own programming language(inter)
### it's a for-fun project, nothing serious.
### ! important ! ---> to make new inter project, just create new file with file type .inter and write the code

## Code:
* ### read --> reads the user input, can only be number
* ### push --> pushes/adds new number to the stack
* ### pop --> deletes the newest number from stack and returns it
* ### add --> adds two numbers
* ### sub --> subtracts two numbers
* ### mul --> multiplies two numbers
* ### div --> divides two numbers
* ### jump0 --> jumps to the specified label if the number at the top of the stack is 0
* ### jumpGreater0 --> jumps to the specified label if the number at the top of the stack is greater than 0
